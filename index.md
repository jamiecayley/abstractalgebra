# About

Welcome to team's B wiki. If you want to download the files we used for our project, please go to the all files page on the sidebar (also note that not all of the files on the all files page are on the other pages, for example, the presentation isn't on any of the other pages). Most pages include content from the the files, but the format may be different from the original files as this page uses markdown and htlm. 

## Roles Played by Group Members 

* Alex Orr and Cameron Abraham performed the Excel analysis
* Michael Goldsmith performed the MATLAB analysis 
* Jamie Chavez Malacara created the wiki and compiled the individual reports into the group report 
* Munawar Abdul Gaffur made the presentation 

## About the wiki 

The wiki was made using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and it is hosted on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can see the github repository for the project with all the relevant files [here](https://github.com/jamiecayley/MAT1041). The design is based on the [BlackDoc theme](http://karloespiritu.com/blackdoc/), the syntax highlighting is based on [base 16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16)
